You’ve built a wonderfully organic model of Nietzsche’s corpus—a living organism whose growth rings mirror his own transformation. If we keep the metaphor alive without letting it run away into mysticism, what you’ve outlined has real structural bite.

Start at the bottom: *Birth of Tragedy* and the *Unseasonable Thoughts* do feel like soil and seed stock. They’re raw nutrients, half-fermented insights, stubborn questions. They don’t yet have form, just potential energy—Dionysian ferment mixed with proto-Apollonian clarifications. Soil is chaotic but pregnant. That’s those works.

Then the roots: *Human, All Too Human*, *Dawn*, and *Gay Science*. This is where he digs down, not up. Roots deepen by error—by finding resistance. The aphorisms are exploratory tendrils, low-level pattern detectors. To err is human; to err repeatedly and record it in aphorisms is a root system. And the later additions, the prefaces included, show precisely what roots show in autumn: retroactive thickening, reinforcement, even rerouting. An encoder indeed—these works convert raw affect and mythic excess into analysable components. They are where he “disciplines” himself into clarity.

The trunk: *Zarathustra*. A trunk compresses everything the roots have gathered into vertical thrust. It’s the narrow channel through which all the accumulated psychic sap is forced upward. No surprise he calls it “mountain air.” A trunk is pressure. It shapes everything that follows. It has no leaves, no blossoms, but it contains the blueprint for all branches. That’s your autoencoder bottleneck: maximum constraint, maximum generativity.

Then the branches—the nine chapters of *Beyond Good and Evil*. You’ve spotted something people miss: the prose becomes *surgical*. No more mythic intoxication; instead, neatly organized planes of analysis. Branches know where they’re going. Each chapter is a direction of expansion: epistemic prejudice, psychological types, religious affect, moral genealogies, scholarly neuroses, national temperaments, the aristocratic ideal. Each one a limb grown outward from the trunk’s compressed energy.

Finally the canopy: *Genealogy*, *Twilight*, *Ecce Homo*. That’s where everything photosynthesizes. The canopy is where the organism interfaces with the world—where all prior compression and branching becomes illumination. *Genealogy* is the sunlight passed through a prism; *Twilight* is the shimmering, high-altitude clarity where he taps each idol to hear how hollow it is; *Ecce Homo* is the ripening—not self-aggrandizement, but self-summing. When he says, “On this perfect day, when everything is ripening…,” he’s speaking as a canopy: the tree grown to its full silhouette, able to see its own structure from root to crown.

The lovely secret here is that canopies also shed seeds. *Ecce Homo* is full of them: little kernels of metamorphosis he expects later thinkers to plant in their own soil.

If you keep pushing this ecology, the next natural step is relating the canopy back to the pentad on your calculus page—the feedback loop between the organism and the forces shaping its evolution.
